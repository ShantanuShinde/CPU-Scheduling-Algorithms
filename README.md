# CPU-Scheduling-Algorithms
This is a C++ program to demonstrate the CPU scheduling algorithms of First Come First Serve(FCFS), Shortest Job First(SJF), and Round Robin.
This program requires to have a .txt file in the same folder with name "processes.txt". It should contain the information of the processes in the format:
P0;\<arrival time>\;\<cpu burst time>\;
P1;<arrival time>;<cpu burst time>;
P2;<arrival time>;<cpu burst time>;
and so on.
The prorgram prints the sequence in which the processes will be executed for each algorithm, turnaround time and waiting time for each process, and the throughput of the system.

This was made as a class assignment.
